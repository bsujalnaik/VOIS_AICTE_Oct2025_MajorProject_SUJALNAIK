## Netflix Data Analysis (AICTE Data Analysis Virtual Internship)

This repository contains a data analysis project on the Netflix catalog, developed as part of the AICTE Data Analysis Virtual Internship facilitated by Edunet Foundation under the VOIS for Tech program.

### Project Overview
- **Goal**: Explore and analyze Netflix titles to uncover insights such as content distribution by type, genres, release trends, ratings, and country-wise availability.
- **Artifacts**:
  - `Netflix_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the complete analysis workflow.
  - `Netflix_Dataset.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.

### Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Core Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly (optional), scikit-learn (if applicable)

### Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - Windows PowerShell:
     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
3. Install dependencies (adjust as needed if you already have a requirements file):
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
   ```
4. Launch Jupyter and open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Then open `Netflix_Analysis.ipynb`.

### Repository Structure
```text
.
├─ Netflix_Analysis.ipynb     # Main analysis notebook
├─ Netflix_Dataset.csv        # Source dataset
└─ README.md                  # Project documentation
```

### How to Use
- Place `Netflix_Dataset.csv` in the project root (same folder as the notebook).
- Open `Netflix_Analysis.ipynb` and run all cells in order.
- Modify parameters or add cells to extend the analysis as needed.

### Analysis Highlights (examples)
- Content distribution by `type` (Movies vs TV Shows)
- Yearly trend of releases
- Top countries and genres
- Rating breakdowns
- Missing data handling and data cleaning steps
- Optional: Simple recommendation or clustering experiments (if included in the notebook)

### Results
Key findings, figures, and tables are embedded within `Netflix_Analysis.ipynb`. Exported plots or summary tables can be saved from the notebook as needed.
